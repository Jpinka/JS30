  // you might think we can just do something like this:

  team[3] = 'Lux';

  // however, what happens when we update that array?

  // now here is the problem

  // oh no - we have edited the orginal array too!

  // Why? Its becasue that an array is an refference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array.

  // so to fix this, we makew a copy instead

  const team2 = players.slice();

  //one day

  // or create a new array and concat the old one in 

  const team3 = [].concat(players);

  // or use the new ES6 spread

  const team4 = [...players];
  team4[3] = 'heeee hawwww';
  console.log(team4);

  const team5 = Array.from(players)

  // now when we update it, the orginal one isnt chnaged

  // the same thing goes for objects, lets say we have a person object

  // with objects
  const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos', 
      age: 80
  };

  // and think we make a copy

  const captain = person;

  // how do we take a copy instead?

  Object.assign({}, person, {number:99, age: 12 });
  console.log(cap2);

  // we will hopefully soon see the object...spread (not in JS yet)

  // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for arrays and objects. eodash? has a cloneDeep method, but your should think twice before using it.
